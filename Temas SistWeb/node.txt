The search results did not provide relevant information for the specific tasks required to enable user registration in an Express application generated by express-generator. However, based on the given tasks, the following steps can be followed to address the requirements:

1. **Add a Registration Page**:
   - Create a new route for the registration page using `router.get` to handle the `GET` request for the "/registro" path. Within this route, render a registration form using a template engine like EJS or Pug.

2. **Create the Registration Form**:
   - The registration form should include fields for the username, password, and password confirmation. Ensure that the form is structured following the existing page templates.

3. **Add Client-Side Validation**:
   - Use client-side JavaScript to validate the password fields, ensuring they match and meet the length requirement. Display appropriate error messages to the user if the validation fails.

4. **Add Server-Side Validation**:
   - Upon form submission, validate the data on the server, including checking if the user already exists. If any validation fails, redirect the user back to the registration page with an error message. If the data is valid, hash the password and store the user information.

5. **Implement User Authentication**:
   - After successful registration, implement user authentication and redirect the user to the desired location, such as the "/restricted" route.

These steps involve modifying the routes, views, and potentially adding client-side and server-side validation logic. The specific implementation will depend on the existing code and the technologies used in the Express application.
